# Inverter Example

In this folder you can find the *"Hello World"* example of IC design: A simple analog inverter in the CMOS technology `gf180mcuD`.

A video tutorial on how to draw a simple inverter using `Xschem` and how to simulate it using `ngspice` is available on [YouTube](add_link). Please follow this tutorial in your local installation of the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS.

A second video tutorial on how to draw the layout of the inverter using `KLayout` is also available on [YouTube](add_link). Please follow this tutorial in your local installation of the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS.

In addition, the following prepared files are available here for your reference:

- `inv.sch`: The schematic of the inverter, designed using `Xschem`.
- `inv.sym`: The symbol for the inverter, also designed using `Xschem`.
- `inv_tb.sch`: The testbench schematic for simulating the inverter, designed using `Xschem` and simulating with `ngspice`. Open this file in `Xschem` using `xschem inv_tb.sch`.
