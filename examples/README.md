# Examples Folder

In this folder you can find the following examples:

- `analog_tutorial`: A simple analog inverter schematic with a simulation testbench (using `Xschem` and `ngspice`) and a layout (using `KLayout`). Then, the layout is drawn using `KLayout` and DRC (design rule check) and LVS (layout vs. schematic) checks are performed.
