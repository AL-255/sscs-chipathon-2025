# MOSbius Track Resources

1. First review the [Brief Overview of the MOSbius Track](./files/MOSbius_Chipathon_2025_kinget_v1.pdf).

2. Then review the [MOSbius Chipathon 2025 Documentation GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JuanMoya/Chipathon2025_MOSbius_main_documentation) -- this will be your main goto place for finding documentation specific for the MOSbius Track. 

3. We also have the [GF180 Analog Design Workflow GitHub Repo Template](https://github.com/Jianxun/iic-osic-tools-project-template) that can be used to set up your project repo on GitHub; especially recommended for those who are new to docker and GitHub. More details are also provided at [MOSbius Chipathon 2025 Documentation GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JuanMoya/Chipathon2025_MOSbius_main_documentation).
